# Pinochle

This is a game I am constructing as a summer project
My family has a long established tradition in 4 handed pinochle.
With me and my siblings heading to college or further, we have
found a need to play pinochle over the internet.
This program will allows us to view a synched user interface to play pinochle together.

REVISION (6/27/2018):
Since I have little experience programming communications between devices, and testing will
be difficult even with two computers, I am going to first construct the rules of the game,
allowing AI players.


REVISION (10/3/2018):
I got a little sidetracked during the summer. I hope to come back and complete this eventually.


NOTE:
I am designing this for my family
Anyone is welcome to use it, though the design will be specific to my circumstances.
My family rules for the game may be hard coded.
IP addresses may also be hard coded, please change that if you intend to use this code.
