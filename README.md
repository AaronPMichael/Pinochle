# Pinochle

This is a game I am constructing as a summer project
My family has a long established tradition in 4 handed pinochle
With me and my siblings heading to college or further, we have
found a need to play pinochle over the internet
This program will allows us to view a synched user interface to play pinochle over
REVISION (6/27/2018):
Since I have little experience programming communications between devices, and testing will
be difficult even with two computers, I am going to first construct the rules of the game,
allowing AI players.


NOTE:
I am designing this for my family
My family rules for the game will be hard coded
IP addresses may also be hard coded, please change that if you intend to use this code
